 <h3> My top 3 movies from 2024:</h3>
 <hr />

 <ul>
    <li> 
        <h4> The Holdovers</h4>
        <p>
            Genre: Comedy<br />
            Duration: 133 min <br />
            Highlights: Very nostalgic and reminiscent of movies from the 90's such as Dead Poets society and Good will hunting. 
            Truly touching and such a demonstration that not everything needs to be a remake to be good
        </p> 
    </li>

    <li> 
        <h4> It's what's inside</h4>
        <p>
            Genre: Comedy, Thriller, Mystery<br />
            Duration: 103 min <br />
            Highlights: I loved this movie, basically it's like mafia a game where people have an
            oppurtunity to walk a short short mile in the shoes of their friends. The movie is fresh 
            and explores themes such as jeolousy and comparisons in friendships. Additionally you 
            really cannot decisde who you are rooting for. One other thing I appreciated is that the 
            end is not polished and presented in a neat little bow, the ending really leaves wondering where does the lives of the charecters go to from here.

    <li> 
        <h4> Inside Out 2</h4>
        <p>
            Genre: Animation, Adventure<br />
            Duration: 96 min <br />
            Highlights: I would have to think really hard to identify a francshice where the sequel
            is just as good as the original. Inside Out was released in 2015, 9 years later and as users
            we currently find ourselves deep in trenches that is Hollywoods aversion to risk resulting in hoards 
            and hoards of sequals and remakes of past Blockblasters. I Had the oppurtunity to watch
            Inside Out 2 in cinemas and can clearly recall the moment when we reached the climax of 
            the movie, practically everyone in the theatre was holding in their breath as if any sound from them
            would immortalise the moment. In maybe not my finest moment I could not
            stop laughing (Ovbiously very quietly) but the moment was so intense and so real that the tension
            literally brought me to a breaking point. Excellent move might even be my favourite movie of 2024
