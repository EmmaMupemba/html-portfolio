<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi my name is Emmanuelah Mupemba, I was born in the Democratic Rebublic of Congo in 2000, if you ask me the year 
  2000 is literally the coolest year to be born and hey maybe i'm just biased. My mom emigrated to South Africa and 
  even though I am congolease South Africa is and will always be home. I obtained my Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical 
  Engineering from the University of Pretoria and currently I am a software engineer.

<p>I remember learning the phrase life long learner in Life Orientation when I was in high School and remember thinking
  who would choose to be a student for their entire life, genuinly it seemed so absurd and yet I find myself literally being 
  just that. I love learning, enjoy learning new things and acquiring random skills that genuinly have very little to do with 
  each other. This passion for learning ultimately explains why I am a mechanical enigineer who has worked in the mining field 
  but also in the software space. I am 25 and have yet to figure out how I want to spend my days, even though I grew up in the 
  age of 9 to 5 Covid 19 has really altered the way I view work, through Covid and tiktok I have been introduced to so many alternatives 
  to the standard 9 to 5 and I genuinly believe that in the next 10 years this model will be less and less common. 
</p>

<p>I am passionate about the world, passionate about living and loving. One of my favourite movies and as of this moment 
  my comfort movie is Pixars Soul. I believe in travelling the world and working in different countries, I believe not dying
  having only lived where you were born. I am passionate about Africa, about being black and about being a women. I 
  am passionate about people and truly believe in the beauty and goodness of human kind, I find that becuase I get so caught up 
  in the routine of life I forget to smell the roses and appreciate exactly where I am, the oppurtunities that have been afforded
  to be becuase of the sacrifices of those who have come before me.
